# GitHub_Top_Topics_Repositories_Web_Scraping_Projects
This is basically a project of web scraping using python and its libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.
In this project I have scraped the topic webpage of GitHub and stored its title, description, and URL in a CSV file.
And then I have scraped the information about top repositories of each topic.
I have scraped information like username of repositories, its name, its number of stars, and its URL.
I have stored all the information of repositories in a CSV file in a folder named 'data' which is being created by OS module of python.
Here is the webpage link that I have scraped :-  https://github.com/topics
